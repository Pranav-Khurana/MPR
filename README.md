# Understanding the Concepts of Brain Nueroimaging 

The Primary objective of this project is to understand and analyze various experiments conducted on brain fMRI images so as provide a deep understanding of human brain. This helps us in understanding, the working of our brain and also helps in detecting and providing solutions to health problems related to brain such as brain tumour.
